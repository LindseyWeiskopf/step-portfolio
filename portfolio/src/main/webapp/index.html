          <p class="bigger-font"><strong>Hi, my name is Lindsey, and it's so nice to meet you!</strong> 
          I am currently a student at Barnard College studying Computer Science, Architecture, and 
          History. I love to create, code,and think critically about the rapidly changing technological 
          world. When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I like to read, curate spotify playlists, and 
          find some of the hidden wonders of the world</p>
          <br><br>
          <h3><i>MY STORY TO CS</i></h3>
          <p>When I was in middle school, I learned how to code on my TI-84 calculator because
          I couldn't remember the quadratic formula. At the time I had no idea that I was programming a 
          small computer, but I realized that I could make my life easier by teaching my calculator
          something that I couldn't teach myself.</p>
          <p>Of course, since then Iâ€™ve programmed more complex machines than a plastic rectangle. And I 
          now understand that when working at its best, CS makes life more accessible for people with different 
          needs, globally.</p>
          <p>Through the lens of accessibility, I have sought exposure to the tech field and its critical 
          intersections. By attending talks and panels with industry and industry-adjacent professionals, 
          I have learned about topics beyond the scope of data structures such as GIS, computer vision, and 
          computer architecture. In turn, I am able to apply the information from my professors such as implementing 
          interfaces and data structures, but I am also able to to apply the interdisciplinary information from professionals 
          on the ground to use GIS software and plan workshops about computer vision for ASL users. Whether I am coding on 
          my TI-84 or on terminal, I now understand how integral CS is to our lives.</p>
